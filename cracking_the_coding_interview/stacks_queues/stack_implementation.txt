Uses LIFO (last in first out). Operations consist of:
    - pop(): Remove the top item of the stack.
    - push(item): Add an item to the top of the stack.
    - peek(): Return the item at the top of the stack.
    - isEmpty(): Returns true if and only if the stack is empty.

They are useful for certain recursive algorithms.
